    <h1>Markus Persson</h1>
    <p>
      Persson began developing video games at an early age, making games both
      professionally and for pleasure for much of his life. He achieved critical
      success upon the publishing of an early version of Minecraft in 2009.
      Prior to the game's official retail release in 2011, it had sold over ten
      million copies.[5][6] After this point, Persson stood down as lead
      designer and transferred creative authority to Jens Bergensten.[7]
